## Philosophy
In order to make ordering an additional bin as easy as possible for a citizen of Stockport, we have developed an online form that will allow the user to select which bin they want along with when thyey want it to be delivered.

This sends a request to our back office and is automatically added to the next shipment of additional bins.

## Installation
```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run start
```
